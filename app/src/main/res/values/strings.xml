<p>Welcome to <b>MoneyFlow</b>, an android app from <a href="http://www.neemshade.com">neemShade.com</a></p>

<p>MoneyFlow aims at helping small and medium scale business people to track their financial transactions.
Provision is there to track transactions of different companies (that you may own).</p>

<p>A company deals with business entities called parties. Your company may receive goods for credit from parties. Likewise, sell goods to other parties and collect money later.
<b>Outstanding payment</b> (sum of all pending payment) that parties owe are listed.</p>

<p>The <b>Pending payment</b> screen shows the transactions that ought to be paid today or by past dates.  Separate tables list the payments towards parties and from parties.</p>

<p>Provision is available to enter a new transaction detail. When you buy or sell goods, you this tab to input the transaction detail.
Also, when a payment is made by your company or by parties, enter the payment detail in the "Payment" tab.
These input made in these two screens will be reflected in the "Outstanding" page.</p>

<p>The current version of MoneyFlow is a trial model using dummy data.  We want your feedback about the screens and user interface.
We are working towards providing real tool, that will store transaction related data and provide useful reports and alerts.</p>
